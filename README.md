## Inspiration
We were inspired to create a point-and-click escape room game as the theme of this event is "into the unknown." We wanted to place the player in a situation where they were in a familiar location but with slight differences. The game's ending reveals that the journey to escape the room was ultimately in vain as the player was in the unknown.

## What it does
The game is point-and-click style, meaning that they are able to interact with certain objects around them to gain clues and hints about how to escape the room. Once you click on a valid object, a text box appears that explains the object and what the player can gain from it. A keypad system was also created on the door, allowing the player to escape when given the correct code.

## How we built it
We built this game using Python and, more specifically, PyGame. We used PyGame to handle the clicking and displaying actions. Paint Tool Sai was used to draw all of the assets by hand.

## Challenges we ran into
We ran into several challenges during the project. One major one was the inability for the background scenery to switch when the red arrows were clicked. Another problem was with getting the inputs of the keypad to be displayed for the user.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We are proud of the fact that the game is able to toggle between screens and that the coordinate system we had for detecting mouse collisions with objects is accurate. We also organized our code in such a way that adding a new object collision with a textbox is easy to do.

## What we learned
We learned how to use PyGame to create an interesting and visually appealing game. Furthermore, we learned more about how to use GitHub in a team setting as well as how to effectively structure our code.

## What's next for N.APT
N.APT would be expanded to include a more complex storyline and clues/puzzles. The user may also have access to other rooms that would house more hints and activities to collect clues.
